# Container-based Action Routing Tool (CART)

[![Build and test](https://github.com/datakind/dk-routing/actions/workflows/docker-actions.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/datakind/dk-routing/actions/workflows/docker-actions.yml)


A tool that enables the planning of container pickup and dropoff at many locations with customizables vehicles (speed, allowed roadways, capacity, etc.)

Documentation can be found on the wiki: https://github.com/datakind/dk-routing/wiki 

Technical instructions are at https://github.com/datakind/dk-routing/blob/main/dkroutingtool/README.md

Developed by volunteers and DataKind, formerly known as DataKind Routing Tool. The initial goal was to provide routing assistance for container-based sanitation organizations and we're open sourcing the tool to make sure it can reach many more use cases and organizations.

# Why would it be useful for me?

Here are some features supported by the current release.

* Routes through hundreds or thousands of locations in minutes
* Minimizes either time or distance across trips (with steep elevation changes as an experimental optimization)
* Specific time windows per area or per location are respected
* Configuration of multiple different vehicles with different speeds, allowable roads and capacities via OSRM profiles
* Detailed maps of the trips in html files
* Possibility of editing the routes via spreadsheets to reorder locations or put a location onto a different trip
* Exports GPX tracks to be used in turn-by-turn navigation tools (e.g. OSM Automated Navigation Directions at https://osmand.net/)

And a sample solution that provides relevant metrics:
